📌 Query #1
👉 Correlation between PM2.5 Days and Respiratory Death Rate (After Join)

Shows how air pollution exposure relates to respiratory deaths in the same location & year.

%sql
SELECT
    a.location_name AS Location,
    a.year AS Year,
    a.Days_PM2_5 AS PM25_Days,
    a.Resp_Death_Rate AS Respiratory_Death_Rate,
    b.value AS Air_Pollution_Impact,
    b.cause_of_death AS Cause_of_Death,
    b.measure AS Measurement_Type,
    b.sex AS Sex
FROM AQI_Respiratory_2019_clean a
LEFT JOIN deaths_by_air_pollution_clean b
    ON a.location_name = b.location
   AND a.year = b.year;


📊 Suggested graph: Scatter Plot

X-axis → PM25_Days

Y-axis → Respiratory_Death_Rate

Series → Location (optional)

📌 Query #2
👉 Respiratory Death Rate vs Air-Pollution % of Deaths

Filter cleaner data using:

Sex = Both

Measurement = Percent of Deaths attributable

Cause = Lower respiratory infections

%sql
SELECT
    a.location_name AS Location,
    a.year AS Year,
    a.Resp_Death_Rate AS Respiratory_Death_Rate,
    b.value AS Percent_Deaths_Air_Pollution
FROM AQI_Respiratory_2019_clean a
JOIN deaths_by_air_pollution_clean b
    ON a.location_name = b.location
   AND a.year = b.year
WHERE b.sex = 'Both'
  AND b.measure = 'Percent of Deaths attributable'
  AND b.cause_of_death = 'Lower respiratory infections';


📊 Suggested graph: Scatter or Bar

X-axis → Location

Y-axis → Percent_Deaths_Air_Pollution

📌 Query #3
👉 Trend: Air-Pollution Death % Over Time by Joined Locations

Helpful for line charts.

%sql
SELECT
    a.location_name AS Location,
    a.year AS Year,
    b.value AS Air_Pollution_Death_Percent
FROM AQI_Respiratory_2019_clean a
JOIN deaths_by_air_pollution_clean b
    ON a.location_name = b.location
   AND a.year = b.year
WHERE b.sex = 'Both'
  AND b.measure = 'Percent of Deaths attributable'
ORDER BY Location, Year;


📊 Suggested graph: Line Chart

Key column → Location

Group → Location

Values → Air_Pollution_Death_Percent
